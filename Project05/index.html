          <p>
            JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time
            compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it
            is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
            non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache
            CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based,
            multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
            object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
            programming) styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language
            Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API
            specification (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a
            feature, we try to document it. This means that cases where some
            proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented
            in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some
            of those new features. Most of the time, this happens between the
            stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially
            published.

        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add
            interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.
            JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience,
            you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics,
            comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more! JavaScript itself
            is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a
            variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a
            vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web
              browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating
              HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video
              stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio
              samples.
            </li>
            <li>
              Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate
              functionality in sites from other content providers, such as
              Twitter or Facebook. Third-party frameworks and libraries that you
              can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and
              applications.

        <h2>Understanding client-side JavaScript frameworks</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            JavaScript frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web
            development, providing developers with tried and tested tools for
            building scalable, interactive web applications. Many modern
            companies use frameworks as a standard part of their tooling, so
            many front-end development jobs now require framework experience. In
            this set of articles, we are aiming to give you a comfortable
            starting point to help you begin learning frameworks. As an aspiring
            front-end developer, it can be hard to work out where to begin when
            learning frameworks — there are so many frameworks to choose from,
            new ones appear all the time, they mostly work in a similar way but
            do some things differently, and there are some specific things to be
            careful about when using frameworks. 
          </p>
          <p>We are not aiming to
            exhaustively teach you everything you need to know about
            React/ReactDOM, or Vue, or some other specific framework; the
            framework teams' own docs (and other resources) do that job already.
            Instead, we want to back up and first answer more fundamental
            questions such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Why should I use a framework? What problems do they solve for me?</li>
            <li>What questions should I ask when trying to choose a framework? Do I even need to use a framework?</li>
            <li>What features do frameworks have? How do they work in general, and how do frameworks' implementations of these features differ?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Inheritance and the prototype chain</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a bit confusing for developers experienced in class-based languages (like Java or C++), as it is dynamic and does not have static types.

            When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this prototype chain. It is possible to mutate any member of the prototype chain or even swap out the prototype at runtime, so concepts like static dispatching do not exist in JavaScript.
            
            While this confusion is often considered to be one of JavaScript's weaknesses, the prototypical inheritance model itself is, in fact, more powerful than the classic model. It is, for example, fairly trivial to build a classic model on top of a prototypical model — which is how classes are implemented.
